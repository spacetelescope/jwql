""" Protect_module wrapper for the ``jwql`` automation platform.

This module provides a decorator to protect against the execution of multiple instances of a module.
Intended for when only ONE instance of a module should run at any given time.
Using this decorator, When a module is run, a Lock file is written.  The Lock file is removed upon completion of the module.
If there is already a lock file created for that module, the decorator will exit before running module specific code.

The file will also contain the process id for reference, in case a lock file exists and
the user does not think it should (i.e. module exited unexpectedly without proper closure)

This decorator is designed for use with JWQL Monitors and Generate functions.
It should decorate a function called "protected_code" which contains the main functionality where locking is required.
