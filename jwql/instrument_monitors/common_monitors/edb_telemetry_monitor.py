Engineering Database Mnemonics Trending Monitor (EDB Trending Monitor)
######################################################################

This module contains code for the Engineering Database Telemetry monitor. For a given mnemonic,
this monitor retrieves telemetry data from the EDB, filters the data based on optional conditions,
calculates some basic statistics on the data, and plots the data.

There is a list of mnemonics to monitor for each instrument, in the form of a json file. For each
mnemonic, the file specifies the conditions for filtering the data. This may include filtering based
on the values of the mnemonic's own data (e.g. keep only entries where the voltage is < 0.25V), and/or
filtering based on the values of dependency mnemonics. For example, keep data for mnemonic A only
when mnemonic B is > 0.25V and mnemonic C is less than 38K.

Statistics
----------

After filtering the data, the monitor calcualtes statistics. The monitor supports several different types
averaging. These include:

1. **daily_means** - This is designed for mnemonics whose values do not change much over the course of a
day. In this case, mnemonic data is retrieved over a small amount of time each day (e.g. 12:00 - 12:15).
From these data, a daily mean is calculated. For all other types of telemetry, the EDB queries span
the full day.

2. **block_means** - These are mnemonics where the user wishes to see mean values associated with each
block of entries in the retrieved and filtered data. For example, you want to examine a voltage at times
when some other current is less than 0.25A. The script will read in all telemetry data, and filter out
data points for times where the current did not meet the criteria. It will then calculate the mean of
each remaining block of continuous good data. So if the data were good from 2:00 to 2:30, then bad until
3:00, and good again from 3:00-4:00, then the monitor will calculate a mean value for the 2:00-2:30
period, and a mean from the 3:00-4:00 period.

3. **time_interval** - Mnemonics in this category have their data retrieved and filtered, and then averaged
over the requested time interval. For example, if the user sets a time interval of 5 minutes, then the
monitor caculates the mean value within each 5-minute block of the total time range of the data, and plots
the average values.

4. **every_change** - This is the most complex case. Mnemonics in this category have their data filtered
and organized based on the value of a secondary mnemonic. For example, the IMIR_HK_GW14_POS_RATIO returns
a measure of the position of MIRI's grating wheel. We can plot this position as a function of the commanded
location of the grating wheel, which is provided by IMIR_HK_GW14_CUR_POS. In this case, the monitor will
loop over the commanded positions and for each, gather the measured position information. The measured
positions associated with each commanded position will then be plotted separately. Note that this use
of "every change" is separate from the idea of every-change telemetry, in which telemetry points are
only generated at times when the telemetry value changes. Some of the mnemonics in the EDB do contain
change-only telemetry data, but this should be largely invisible to the EDB Telemetry Monitor user.

5. **all** - In this case, no averaging is done. (Although filtering is still done) All filtered data
are kept as they are retrived from the EDB, and plotted without any modification.

6. **all+daily_means** - This is a combination of the "all" and "daily_means" cases above. All data points
are retrieved from the EDB and optionally filtered by dependencies. Then daily means are calculated.
Both the full set of data and the daily means are plotted, along with deviations from the mean.

7. **all+block_means** - This is a combination of the "all" and "block_means" cases above. All data points
are retrieved from the EDB and optionally filtered by dependencies. Then means for each block of good data
are calculated. Both the full set of data and the means are plotted, along with deviations from the mean.

8. **all+time_interval** - This is a combination of the "all" and "time_interval" cases above. All data points
are retrieved from the EDB and optionally filtered by dependencies. Then means are calculated for each block
of time lasting the duration of the time interval. Both the full set of data and the means are plotted, along
with deviations from the mean.

JSON file format
----------------

The type of data averaging is at the top level of the JSON file. Values must match the 8 types described above.
The entry for each mnemonic has several pieces of information, described below.

- **name**: Name of the mnemonic as it appears in the EDB.
- **database_id** Optional name to use in the plot title for this mnemonic. Any averaged data saved to the JWQL database will be saved under this name if it is present.
- **description**: Summary describing the data contained in the mnemonic. Placed in the plot title.
- **dependency**: This is a list of mnemonics and conditions that will be used to filter the data
- **plot_data**: Description of how the data are to be plotted. There are two options: "nominal", in which case
  the mnemonic data are plotted as-is, and "*<mnem>" where <mnem> is the name of another mnemonic. In this case, the
  data for this second mnemonic are retrieved using the same dependencies as the primary mnemonic. The primary mnemonic
  and this second mnemonic are then multiplied together and plotted. This option was designed around plotting power as
  the product of current and voltage.

A further option for the **"plot_data"** field is the addition of a comma-separated list of statistics to be overplotted.
Options are: "mean", "median", "max", and "min". Note that this is a little confusing, because in many cases the menmonic's
data will already contain the median value of the data (and the original data as returned from the EDB will not be
available). The monitor realized this though, so if you specify "mean" for a mnemonic in the "daily_mean" list, it will simply
plot the same data twice, on top of itself.

As an example, in order to plot the daily mean and maximum values of the product of SE_ZIMIRICEA and SE_ZBUSVLT, the plot_data
entry would be: "*SE_ZBUSVLT,max". If you also wanted to plot the minimum daily value, the entry would be: "*SE_ZBUSVLT,max,min".
And similarly, to plot SE_ZIMIRICEA on its own (not as a product), the plot_data entries shown above would become: "nominal,max"
and "nominal,max,min".

* **nominal_value**: Optional. The "expected" value for this mnemonic. If provided, a horizontal dashed line will be added at this value.
* **yellow_limits**: Optional. This is a list of two values that describe the lower and upper limits of the expected range of the mnemonic's value. If these are present, a green background is added to the plot at values between these limits. Outside of these limits, the background is yellow.
* **red_limits**: Optional. Similar to yellow_limits above. In this case the lower and upper limits represent the thresholds outside of which there may be a problem. In this case, the background of the plot outside of these values is red.
* **plot_category**: This is the name of the tab on the website into which this plot should be placed.
* **mean_time_block**: Optional. This is only used for ``time_interval`` mnemonics. It describes the length of time over which to bin and average the data. The value consists of a number and a unit of time: e.g. "15_minutes"

Below we present details on how to construct json entries for these specific cases.

"daily_means" entries
=====================
Here is an example of two **daily_mean** telemetry entries in the json file. In both, SE_ZIMIRICEA values are retrieved.
For the first plot, data are only kept for the times where the following dependencies are true:

1. SE_ZIMIRICEA is > 0.2 A
2. IMIR_HK_ICE_SEC_VOLT1 is < 1 V
3. IMIR_HK_IMG_CAL_LOOP is OFF
4. IMIR_HK_IFU_CAL_LOOP is OFF
5. IMIR_HK_POM_LOOP is OFF

For the second plot, data are kept for the times where:

1. IMIR_HK_ICE_SEC_VOLT1 is > 25 V

Note that the "database_id" entry is used to differentiate the plot labels of these two cases, as well as their entries in the JWQLDB.
In both cases, the data are plotted as the product of SE_ZIMIRICEA and SE_ZBUSVLT. In the second case, the maximum daily value is also
plotted. Both plots are placed in the ``power`` tab on the webpage.

                "plot_category": "power"
            }
        ]
    }


For a case with no dependencies, the "dependencies" keyword can be left empty:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "name": "INRC_ICE_DC_VOL_P5_DIG",
        "description": "ICE HK +5V voltage for digital electronics",
        "dependency": [],

        "red_limits": [4.5, 5.5],
        "plot_category": "ice_voltage"
    }


"block_means" entries
=====================
In the example shown below, we want to plot IMIR_HK_ICE_SEC_VOLT1 at times when it has values higher
than 25V. In this case, the EDB monitor will find times when the voltage is under the 25V limit. These
times will separate the blocks of time when the voltage does meet the threshold value. It then calculates
and plots the median voltage within each of these blocks.

.. code-block:: json

    "block_means":[
        {
            "name": "IMIR_HK_ICE_SEC_VOLT1",
            "database_id": "IMIR_HK_ICE_SEC_VOLT1_OPS",
            "description": "ICE Secondary Voltage (HV) 1",
            "dependency": [
                {
                    "name": "IMIR_HK_ICE_SEC_VOLT1",
                    "relation": ">",
                    "threshold": 25
                }
            ],
            "plot_data": "nominal",
            "nominal_value": 39.24,
            "yellow_limits": [39.14, 39.34],
            "plot_category": "ICE_voltage"
        }

"time_interval" entries
=======================

For mnemonics to be averaged over some time period, use the "mean_time_block" entry.
The value of mean_time_block should be a number followed by an underscore and a unit
of time. Currently, the unit must contain one of "min", "sec", "hour", or "day". The
monitor looks for one of these strings within the mean_time_block entry, meaning that
"second", "seconds", "minutes", "minute", "hours", "days", etc are all valid entries.

In the example below, the EDB monitor will bin the SE_ZINRCICE1 data into 5 minute blocks,
and calculate and plot the mean of each block.

.. code-block:: json

    "time_interval": [
        {
            "name": "SE_ZINRCICE1",
            "description": "ICE1 current",
            "mean_time_block": "5_min",
            "dependency": [],
            "plot_data": "nominal",
            "yellow_limits": [0.36, 0.8],
            "red_limits": [0, 1.367],
            "plot_category": "box_current"
        }
    ]

"every_change" entries
======================

This is a complex case and at the moment is customized for the MIRI filter wheel position
mnemonics such as IMIR_HK_FW_POS_RATIO. In this case, the EDB monitor will retrieve data for
the filter wheel position, which is a float at each time. It will also retrive the commmanded
position of the filter wheel, which is a string at each time (e.g. OPEN, CLOSED). It then divides
the filter wheel postiion data into groups based on the value of the commanded position (i.e. group
together all of the postion data when the commanded position is OPEN). It then computes the median
value of the filter position within each continuous block of time where the commanded position is
constant. This median value is then normalized by the expected location value (retrieved from
constants.py). One line is plotted for each commanded position.

.. code-block:: json

    "every_change": [
        {
            "name": "IMIR_HK_FW_POS_RATIO",
            "description": "FW normalized position sensor voltage ratio",
            "dependency": [
                {
                    "name": "IMIR_HK_FW_CUR_POS",
                    "relation": "none",
                    "threshold": 0
                }
            ],
            "plot_data": "nominal",
            "yellow_limits": [-1.6, 1.6],
            "plot_category": "Position_sensors"
        }
    ]

"all" entries
=============
In this case, no grouping or averaging of data from the EDB are done. Data are retrieved from the EDB,
filtered by any dependencies, and plotted.

.. code-block:: json

    "all": [
        {
            "name": "SE_ZINRCICE1",
            "description": "ICE1 current",
            "dependency": [],
            "plot_data": "nominal",
            "yellow_limits": [0.36, 0.8],
            "red_limits": [0, 1.367],
            "plot_category": "box_current"
        },
        {
            "name": "SE_ZINRCICE2",
            "description": "ICE2 current",
            "dependency": [],
            "plot_data": "nominal",
            "yellow_limits": [0.38, 0.86],
            "red_limits": [0, 1.372],
            "plot_category": "box_current"
        }
    ]

"all+daily_means" entries
=========================
This is a combination of the "daily_means" and "all" cases above.

"all+block_means" entries
=========================
This is a combination of the "all" and "block_means" cases above.

"all+time_interval" entries
===========================
This is a combination of the "all" and "time_interval" cases above.


Summary of the EDB monitor operation
------------------------------------

The monitor is set up to find the total span of time over which the plots are requested
(with the default being contolled by the value in jwql.utils.constants). It loops over
each mnemonic and breaks the total time to be queried up into 24-hour long blocks. It then
queries the EDB once for each day-long block, filters the data based on any dependencies given
and then calculates statistics. Breaking the queries up into day-long blocks is done in order
to avoid having the EDB return a very large table, which could cause memory problems, or slow
the monitor down. This is a possibility because in some cases, mnemonic values are present at
cadences of > 1 Hz.

After data are filtered and averaged (and combined with the data of a second mnemonic if they
are being plotted as a product), any new data are saved to the JWQL database. This will prevent
having to repeat the calculations during future queries. For mnemonics where no averaging is
done, we do not save anything in the JWQL databases, in order to save memory.

Each time a query is initiated, the JWQL database is checked first and any relevent data are
retrieved. In this way, we only query the EDB for new data.

The monitor creates one plot for each specified mnemonic. These plots are organized into
"plot_categories", as seen in the json examples above. All plots for a given category are placed
together in a bokeh gridplot. Each gridplot (i.e. plot_category) is then placed in a separate
bokeh tab, in order to try and keep related plots together while not overwhelming the user
with too many plots at once. The tabbed plots are written out to a json file. When the user
clicks on the EDB Telemetry Monitor link on the web app, this json file is read in and embedded
into the html file that is displayed. With this method, EDB queries and data calculations are all
done asynchronously, which means that the EDB Telemetry Monitor web page shoudl be fast to load.

    mnem_name : str
        Name of the mnemonic being plotted. This will be used to generate a filename in the
        case where the figure is saved.

    units : astropy.units.unit
        Units associated with the data. This will be used as the y-axis label in the plot

    show_plot : bool
        If True, show plot on screen rather than returning div and script

    savefig : bool
        If True, file is saved to html file

    out_dir : str
        Directory into which the html file is saved

    nominal_value : float
        Expected or nominal value for the telemetry. If provided, a horizontal dashed line
        at this value will be added.

    yellow_limits : list
        2-element list giving the lower and upper limits outside of which the telemetry value
        is considered non-nominal. If provided, the area of the plot between these two values
        will be given a green background, and that outside of these limits will have a yellow
        background.

    red_limits : list
        2-element list giving the lower and upper limits outside of which the telemetry value
        is considered worse than in the yellow region. If provided, the area of the plot outside
        of these two values will have a red background.

    xrange : tuple
        Tuple of min, max datetime values to use as the plot range in the x direction.

    yrange : tuple
        Tuple of min, max datetime values to use as the plot range in the y direction.

    title : str
        Will be used as the plot title. If None, mnem_name will be used as the title

    return_components : bool
        If True, the components (script, div) of the figure will be returned

    return_fig : bool
        If True, the Bokeh figure will be returned

    minimal_start : datetime.datetime
        In the case where the data to be plotted consists of no or only one point, use this
        as the earliest date in the plot

    minimal_end : datetime.datetime
