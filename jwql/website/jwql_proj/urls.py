"""Maps URL paths to views in the ``jwql`` project.

This module connects requested URL paths to the corresponding view in
``views.py`` for each webpage in the JWQL application. When Django is
provided a path, it searches through the urlpatterns list provided
here until it finds one that matches. It then calls the assigned view
to load the appropriate webpage, passing an HttpRequest object.

Notes
-----

    Be aware that when a url is requested, it will be directed to the
    first matching path in the ``urlpatterns`` list that it finds. The
    ``<str:var>`` tag is just a placeholder. To avoid complications,
    users should order their paths in order from shortest to longest,
    and after that from most to least specific.
