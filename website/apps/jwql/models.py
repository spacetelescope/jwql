"""Defines the models for the ``jwql`` app.

** CURRENTLY NOT IN USE **

In Django, "a model is the single, definitive source of information
about your data. It contains the essential fields and behaviors of the
data youâ€™re storing. Generally, each model maps to a single database
table" (from Django documentation). Each model contains fields, such
as character fields or date/time fields, that function like columns in
a data table. This module defines models that might be used to store
data related to the JWQL webpage. Interacts with the database located
at jwql/website/db.sqlite3.
