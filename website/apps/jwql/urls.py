"""Maps URL paths to views in the ``jwql`` app.

This module connects requested URL paths to the corresponding view in
``views.py`` for each webpage in the ``jwql`` app. When django is
provided a path, it searches through the ``urlpatterns`` list provided
here until it finds one that matches. It then calls the assigned view
to load the appropriate webpage, passing an ``HttpRequest`` object.

Notes
-----
    Be aware that when a url is requested, it will be directed to the
    first matching path in the ``urlpatterns`` list that it finds. The
    ``<str:var>`` tag is just a placeholder. To avoid complications,
    users should order their paths in order from shortest to longest,
    and after that from most to least specific.
